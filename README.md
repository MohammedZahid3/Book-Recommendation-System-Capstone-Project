![IMG_20230508_235607](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96717126/236902219-fff916db-c9b9-4bbd-9e91-ff6f283cdd33.jpg)

# Project Summary :-
**As the internet continues to expand and more users come online, it has become increasingly crucial for companies to provide relevant information tailored to the preferences of their users. One effective way to provide personalized service is through the use of a recommendation system. This system utilizes algorithms and data analysis techniques to suggest items, content, or services that are likely to appeal to customers based on their previous choices or by analyzing the preferences of similar users. Leading companies such as Netflix and Amazon utilize recommender systems to help their users find the right products or content for their needs.**

# Objective:-
**The main objective of this project is to create a Book recommendation system that best predicts user interests and recommend the suitable/appropriate books to them using various approaches.**


# Dataset information
**Dataset used in this project is the Amazon Book-crossing dataset.This dataset has been compiled by Cai-Nicolas Ziegler in 2004, and it comprises of three file.They are:**

**Users**

- **`User-ID:` A unique identification number for each user**
- **`Location:` It contains city,state and country to which the user belongs ,separated by commas**
- **`Age:` The age of the user**

**Books**

- **`ISBN:` International Standard Book Number unique to each edition of the book**
- **`Book-Title:` Title of the book**
- **`Book-Author:` Author of the book(incase of several authors only the first is provided**
- **`Year-of-Publication:` The year in which the particular edition of the book was published**
- **`Publisher:` Name of the Book Publishing company**
- **`Image-URL-S:` URL link to a small version of the book cover displayed on the Amazon website**
- **`Image-URL-M:` URL link to Medium version image of the book cover displayed on the Amazon website**
- **`Image-URL-L:` URL link to Large sized image of the book cover displayed on the Amazon website**


**Ratings**

- **`User-ID:` as mentioned above**
- **`ISBN:` as mentioned above**
- **`Book-Rating:` The rating given by the user (identified by User-ID) for the book (identified by ISBN). It is either explicit,expressed on a scale from 1-10 (higher values denoting higher appreciation), or implicit,expressed by 0.**

# Project Work flow :-

- **Importing Neccessary Libraries**
- **Data Wrangling**
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**

- **Types of recommendation systems**
- **1. Popularity Based recommendation system**

      -  Weighted average rating approach
      -  Country-wise approach
      -  Author-wise approach 
      
- **2. Collaborative Filitering Based recommendation system** 

      -  Memory Based approach - KNN (similarity between items)
      -  Model Based approach- SVD based recommendation system (prediction of ratings)
      
 
- **Model Evaluation**

- **Conclusion**    


# Methodologies Utilized

**The approaches used in this project are:**

**1.Popularity Based recommendation system**

**It is a type of recommendation system that bases choices on factors like popularity and/or current trends. These systems determine which item (in this case,books) are in the trending list or are the most well-liked by users and then directly recommend them.**

- **Weighted average rating approach**
- **Country-wise approach**
- **Author-wise approach**

**2.Collaborative Filitering Based recommendation system**

**The Collaborative Filtering approach first investigates the userâ€™s behaviors, interests, and searches for similar users. It recommends items to users based on the ratings of similar users on various items and by predicting the missing ratings of the items . CF is broadly classified as memory-based and model-based CF.**

- **Memory Based approach - KNN (similarity between items)**
- **Model Based approach- SVD based recommendation system (prediction of ratings)**

# Conclusion :-

- **The Lovely Bones: A Novel and Wild Animus are the two most read books.**
- **Stephen King is the most popular book author based on the number of ratings.**
- **Ballantine Books and Pocket are the top publishers based on the number of ratings that their books have received.**
- **The majority of readers are between the ages of 25 and 40.**
- **The majority of readers who have given the books ratings are from the United States and Canada.**
- **Regardless of the age group, The Lovely Bones and Wild Animus appear on lists of the top-rated books.**
- **We have built five types of recommendation systems and did evaluation for one of them.**
- **In the case of Memory-based approach, the Cosine similarity-based KNN performs better at recommending books that are similar than the Euclidean distance-based KNN.**
- **After evaluation for Collaborative-Model Based Recommendation system, we got a recall@5 of 30% and recall@10 of 41%.**
